A repository of (possibly) interesting data exploration and analytics project, some self-driven and others for a masters program


Analysis #1 -- Finding a Bargain Defensive Ace;
    I gather data for all shots taken in the 2014-2015 NBA season, and use data on the nearest defender for each shot to determine which players have the greatest individual defensive impact relative to their peers. Player salaries from this season are used to identify the greatest bargains.
    
Analysis #2 -- Simulating Oil Port Facilities Expansion to Meet Changing Trade Demands;
    An analysis of a major expansion of the Texas Port of Corpus Christi in the wake of United States' lifting of crude oil export embargo in 2015. Using ARENA simulation software, we analyze bottlenecks and propose specific infrastructure investments needed to ensure optimal waiting times for all vessel types.
