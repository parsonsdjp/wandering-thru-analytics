    "Goal: Many metrics exist to quantify the defensive impact of NBA players. The difficulty of such measures is that it five players (of varying capabilities) are on the floor at any given time. Metrics such as defensive efficiency when a given player is on the floor cannot be directly compared between members of different teams; even a good defensive player on a bad defensive team is likely to be poor in this metric compared to a bad defensive player on a good team.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, let's establish a quantitative estimate (in added/removed points) of the impact of on-ball defense for each player. Compare each player's performance against their present salary to find market value.\n",
    "\n",
    "How: Compare the effective FG % (eFG%) for each offensive player j on average to the eFG% when guarded by defensive player i. \n",
    "\n",
    "Caveat 1: Certain players may play significant defensive minutes against some players and next to none against others. The eFG% differential for each ij pair must be multiplied by the number of shots defended (num_shots[i,j]) so that undue influence is not given to ij pairs with a small sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Caveat 2: We are naturally interested in promising players that are cheap. These may be players that simply don't get large minutes on their current roster, but perform well in the minutes they do receive. Therefore, we will normalize all aij pairs on a per-36 minute basis."

This accounts for the fact that when a lower probability 3 point shot is made, 50% more points are awarded.\n",
